API painpoints

* Lack of user authentication endpoint
* Lack of API token requires us to keep the users' password in memory and pass it along with every request
* Can't fetch a comment on it's own, and the response from creating a comment only includes the ID
* API responses don't include ETags

API ideas

* Read-only node app on top of MySQL database
* Passthrough write operations to existing JSON RPC or REST APIs
